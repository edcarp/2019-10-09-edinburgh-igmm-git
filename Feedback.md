# Course feedback

# The good

* The structure of the course was really good & comprehensible. Speed of the course was very good.
* Well paced. Good exercises.
* Good amount of hands-on time.
* Good pace and amount of content for the available time. 
* Lots of hands on activities, very good practice! Friendly + helpful tutor :). Good examples to explain how different commands are useful.
* I felt like I learnt a lot. It was engaging.
* Useful to see how code can be shared with collaborators.
* Likes: sticky notes, pace of the lecture seemed suitable.
* Good examples and exercises - they really helped give context to what we were learning.
* Very patient. Informative: I know how to use git now!

# The not so good

* Useful to have access to web addresses and code text so reading from the projector not required.
* Would have been helpful to see all commands being used like a "history" to keep track when you fall behing a bit.
* Good introduction to Git. Maybe write down each new command on the board just in case we forget later on, cause we are learning so many different commands at once.
* Maybe more independent tasks and slightly less watching Mario code?
* Sometimes the class felt a little rushed maybe leave more time for  exercises or explain more slowly!
* Could be more structured like the EDDIE course.
